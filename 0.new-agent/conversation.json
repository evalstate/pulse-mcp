The method can vary slightly depending on the type of tea (black, green, herbal, etc.), but I'll provide some general guidelines.\n\nFor a traditional British-style cup of black tea:\n\n1. Start with fresh, cold water\n2. Boil water to the right temperature (around 100\u00b0C/212\u00b0F for black tea)\n3. Warm your teapot or mug first by rinsing it with hot water\n4. Add tea leaves or a tea bag to the pot/mug\n5. Pour the hot water over the tea\n6. Let it steep for 3-5 minutes (depends on how strong you like it)\n7. Remove the tea bag or strain the leaves\n\nNow, to address the age-old debate of milk before or after water:\n- For a traditional British approach, milk goes in AFTER the tea has brewed\n- Putting milk in first was historically done with delicate china to prevent cracking from hot water\n- Modern recommendation is to add milk after brewing to better control the tea's strength\n\nDifferent tea types have different ideal brewing methods, so the technique can vary. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific type of tea?"
